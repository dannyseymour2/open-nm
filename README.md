## Overview

OpenNM Data is a multi-purpose solution for data acquisition
and analytics for public information on New Mexico state and local-level
government. While many of these data are currently public and accessible online,
the data are not well indexed or easily searchable. OpenNM Data makes these data
actionable by insourcing the external state and local databases, cleaning and structuring the data,
and providing a robust querying function that returns data presentations for export and 
use on multiple platforms. This app functions as an "answer engine" allowing
smart searching, computations, forecasting, and summary statistics on government
expenditure data.
